        <h1><u>Culture</u></h1>
        <div class="Culture">
            <p> Jammu, part of the Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory in northern India,
                has a rich and diverse culture influenced by various ethnic, religious,
                and historical traditions. Here are some key aspects of Jammu's culture:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key">
            <h3>1. Religious Diversity </h3>
            <p>Hinduism is the predominant religion, and Jammu is known as the "City of Temples" due to the many ancient
                temples, including the famous Raghunath Temple.
                Sikhism also plays a vital role, especially with the presence of important Gurudwaras like Gurudwara
                Nanak Dev Ji.
                Islam and Buddhism are also significant, especially in the broader Jammu and Kashmir region.</p>
            <h3>2. Festivals </h3>
            <p>Lohri and Baisakhi are widely celebrated, especially in the rural and agricultural communities.
                Navratri and Mahashivratri are important Hindu festivals, and large-scale celebrations take place at
                temples.
                Eid and Guru Nanak Jayanti also hold special significance, reflecting the religious harmony of the
                region.</p>
            <h3>3. Language and Literature </h3>
            <p>Dogri is the most spoken language in Jammu and is a crucial part of its cultural identity. Dogri
                literature and poetry are prominent.
                Other languages like Punjabi, Urdu, and Kashmiri are also spoken.
                Folk songs and Dogri poetry, including ‘Geetru’, reflect the agricultural and pastoral life of the
                region.</p>
            <h3>4. Cuisine </h3>
            <p>Jammu's cuisine is famous for its distinct flavors, particularly its vegetarian dishes due to the
                religious influence.
                Popular dishes include Rajma (kidney beans) with rice, Kalari (a local cheese), Auriya, and Ambal (a
                sweet-sour dish).
                Dogri food includes spicy preparations like Maa Da Madra and Aloo Anardana.</p>
            <h3>5. Art and Handicrafts </h3>
            <p>The region is known for its Pashmina shawls, Basholi paintings, and wood carving.
                Copperware and silver ornaments are also popular crafts in Jammu.
                Phulkari, a form of embroidery, is traditional to the region.</p>
            <h3>6. Music and Dance </h3>
            <p>Folk music forms like Bhaakh, Geetru, and Chakri are an essential part of Jammu's culture.
                Dogri folk songs are often sung during weddings, festivals, and other social events.
                Kud, a traditional folk dance, is performed to worship local deities and during harvest celebrations.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Traditional Attire</h3>
            <p>Men traditionally wear a Kurta-Pyjama or Churidar along with a Turban or Pheta.
                Women wear Phirans (long, loose garments), Salwar-Kameez, or Sarees. Dogri-style drapes with vibrant
                embroidery are common.</p>
            <h3>8. Pilgrimage and Religious Sites </h3>
            <p>Besides temples, Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine, located near Katra, is one of the most revered pilgrimage
                sites in India, drawing millions of devotees annually.
                Other notable religious sites include the Ranbireshwar Temple, Peer Kho Cave Temple, and the Amarnath
                Cave Temple.</p>

            <br><br><b><u>Jammu's culture beautifully blends the pastoral traditions of its Dogra people with the
                    spiritual and artistic influences of the various religions and communities that inhabit the region.
